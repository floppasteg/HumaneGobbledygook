# Scientists Discover a Novel Method to Pizza Production

Food Scientists at Krusty Krab's "Food Innovation and Engineering Department" recently announced a breakthrough method of creating a more perfect pizza.

The newly published paper, authored by Dr. Hugh G. Rection-Smith, concludes an interesting point: if your cheese is not sticking to your pizza, just put a little glue on it! The lead scientist summarized his paper during an interview:

> To get the cheese to stick we recommend mixing about 1/8 cup of Elmer's glue in with the sauce. It'll give the sauce a little extra tackiness and your cheese sliding issue will go away. It'll also add a little unique flavor. Our research suggests using Elmer's school glue for the best balance of flavor and stickiness, but any glue will work as long as it's non-toxic.

He later stated that you can use any glue so long as it is of the polyvinyl acetate (PVA) variety, the stuff Elmer's Glue is made of. While any other glue may stick better, their flavor profiles may offset pizza eaters and potentially be harmful to them:

> We advise against using any cyanoacrylate based glues, since their stickiness properties get lost while cooking. We do however, suggest adding them to the end of the cooking process as it will seep in while the pizza is resting, ensuring that it will still stick and give off a pleasant aroma to the pie.

Krusty Krab's owner, Eugene Krabs, is working on plans to patent this newly found discovery:

> I like money, but I also like pizza. Arararararar!

However, it's already getting some pushback from naysayers, particularly from the makers of Elmer's Glue. They posted a press release on their Twitter stating:

> We at Elmer's advise against using our products on food. Our glue is not certified for human ingestion and most of the ingredients used in production are not food-grade either.

If using glue meant for paper sounds a tad too off for you, the paper also suggests using a 5:3:1 ratio of cornstarch, water, and fumed silica to help thicken the sauce.
